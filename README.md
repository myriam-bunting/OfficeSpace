# OfficeSpace
--------------------
## What? 
Welcome to the HotDesk office space. Office Space is a text-based maze game where the objective is to find your resume.. lost somewhere within the office. There are many paths to choose. Moves are set and counted down, such that when a player runs out of moves, the game is over. THe game can also be won by finding the resume. 

### How to PLay 
The player navigates the rooms using North, south, east, west buttons. Pick up and respond buttons are used within the game to collect objects to a backpack and react to charcters within the game either with verbal or physical reactions. Items collected will reward player with moves while the respond and pick up button will deplete moves. 

## Where?
Access the web-based game through this link: [title](http://127.0.0.1:5501/Project1/index.html)

## How?
The map is designed such that rooms are in an array located in the .json file. Each room has it's set up defined within the object. 

New players are created on start game, setting their own names and types. Types are set to 5, but can be extended. Moves are started and count down

## Why? 
The idea came from a dungeon crawl based game but made more relatable to a larger audiance 

## Want to contribute or extend? 

The game was made with the vision to be extended. Rooms can be added to the array with paths set based on directions. Similarly character types can be added to the array or character classes can be extended to help you create your vision. 

My ideas include: 
- Displaying a map for players
- Adding an input box for vewrbal responses
- Weapon damage to defest 'monster' characters
